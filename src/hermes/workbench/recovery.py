"""Phase 3.4 crash recovery.

On process startup, scan the persisted :class:`JobStore` and resolve
non-terminal jobs left over from a previous (crashed) run. Strategy per
ADR-0002:

* PENDING  → skipped (waiting for explicit submit or DAG upstream)
* QUEUED   → re-enqueue (job is ready, no worker has consumed it yet)
* RUNNING  → mark ABANDONED (we cannot safely resume mid-execution)

Each recovery action (requeue / abandon) is recorded as an L2 episode with
``kind="recovery"`` when a :class:`MemoryService` is wired in.

If ``enabled=False`` (HERMES_SCHEDULER_RECOVERY=off), QUEUED and RUNNING are
both marked ABANDONED — the operator has opted out of automatic recovery.

Stdlib-only; reuses ``JobStore`` (Lock + atomic_write_json) and
``JobQueue`` from :mod:`hermes.workbench.scheduler`.
